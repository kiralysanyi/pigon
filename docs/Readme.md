# Pigon docs

## Frontend

We have multiple frontends for Pigon.

- An android app
- Webui written in React
- Webui made with vanilla js (included in backend)

Links

- [Android app](https://github.com/kiralysanyi/pigon-android/)
- [Webui (react)](https://github.com/kiralysanyi/pigon-react/)

## Backend

The backend is available in this repo, this is the main repository

### Backend technical things

#### Authentication
- Hashing passwords with `sha256` using the included `node:crypto` library
- Using JWT tokens + we include a deviceID inside every token which we check in the db too. This is needed for remote logout (removing devices).
- Optionally, we include support for passkey authentication on all clients

#### Message handling

- We are using `socket.io` to deliver messages realtime (mostly undocumented)
- There are some REST API endpoints available for fetching messages from the past.

#### User Account controls

- Delete user
- Change password
- Add passkey / remove all passkey
- Optionally: you can add your full name and a biography, which is displayed on your profile (only available in oldui and android app, partially supported in pigon-react)

#### Database

  - public: this contains the integrated ui (a.k.a oldui)
  - webauthn: webauthn library fork (git submodule)
  - things: things, utils, helpers

  ## Some code snippets because why the hell not

  ### Auth middleware

  ```js
  let authMiddleWare = async (req, res, next) => {
        if (!req.cookies.token) {
            res.status(403).json({
                success: false,
                message: "Failed to verify user"
            });
            return;
        }
    
        let verificationResponse = await verifyToken(req.cookies.token);
        if (verificationResponse.success == false) {
            res.status(403).json({
                success: false,
                message: "Failed to verify token"
            });
            return;
        }

        let userdata = verificationResponse.data;
        req.userdata = userdata;
        next();
        }
  ```

What the heck does this do?

Checks for token in cookies, verifies jwt token if exists, and adds userdata to req object and continues
